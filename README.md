This is a Password Generator Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate secure and random passwords with customizable options like including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The application features a dynamic password length slider, a visual strength indicator that changes color based on password strength (weak, medium, strong), and a copy-to-clipboard functionality with smooth animation. The UI is designed to be clean, responsive, and interactive, making it easy to generate strong passwords for improving online security. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, randomization logic, and front-end design skills, and can be easily deployed on GitHub Pages for live use.
